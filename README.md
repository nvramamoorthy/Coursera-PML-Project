# Coursera-PML-Project

#####This repository is for Coursera Project,  'Practical Machine Learning'   offered by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of of Public Health.

The project is about HAR - Human Activity Recognition , where 6  participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways and the relevant data were collected using the devices like  Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit which were worn by the paricipants.

The project is about HAR - Human Activity Recognition , where 6  participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways and the relevant data were collected using the devices like  Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit which were worn by the paricipants.

The participant  normally  quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

The goal is  to assess whether we could detect mistakes in weight-lifting exercises by using activity recognition techniques. we recorded users performing the same activity correctly and with a set of common mistakes with wearable sensors and used machine learning to classify each mistake. 

This way, we used the training data as the activity specification and the classification algorithm as the means to compare the execution to the specification.

Our aim is to build a prediction model algorithm , cross validate and find the out of sample error. 

We tested the prediction model on 20 different Test cases and submitted the result as required.
