# Coursera-PML-Project
This repository is for Coursera Project,  'Practical Machine Learning'   offered by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of of Public Health.

The project is about HAR - Human Activity Recognition , where 6 participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways and the relevant data were collected using the devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit which were worn by the paricipants.

The participant regularly quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

The dataset contains data on 5 classes (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting) collected on 8 hours of activities through those devices.

The aim to train a model based on the data of various sensor values, which could later be used to predict the Classe variable, that is the manner in which the participants of HAR did the exercise.
